a simple home automation project




Project Good-MoRe-ning (see what I did there?)

Overview

	At a certain time a program in a raspberry pi will execute the following tasks

		First a coffe machine turns on

		A few miniutes later (about when the coffe is ready), the curtains roll up

		Last but not least, the Pi plays a spotify playlist on speakers




Gear up:

	Get a raspberry pi

	set it up (I saved some tutorials on youtube)

Starting up:

	Make it control a led (just for learning and testing)

	Make it turn it on and off at speciffic hours

Building:

	Basics: 

		Make a script that executes a function every day at a certain time

		The script will controll the next functionalities
	
	Curtains:

		Hook An electric engine up

		Control the engine

		Use some mecanism to make sure the engie does not breake from excessive effort if the curtain gets stuck

		Make the engine roll the curtain up and down

		set buttons to do that (optional)

		Make the curtains roll up when Good-MoRe--ning runs


	Coffe maker:

		Same as curtains but:

			A solenoidinstead of a motor 

			attach solenoid to coffe maker

			Coffe maker must turn on before the the curtain rolls up

	Music: 

		Start playing music from an spotify in speakers attached to the raspberry pi
